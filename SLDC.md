# SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE

1. Planning -> CEO does in startup (whether idea will work or not)
2. Analysis -> Technical analysis (whether it is technically possible or not) & Business Analysis.  

3. Design -> Abode XD, Figma , Sketch(for mac) used for designing
System architect decides the blueprint of the project ( What should be the backend,frontend and database).

  - brings everyone together
  - prototyping is easerier
4. Implementation ( developers do )
5. Testing & Integration
6. Maintenance (Support Team) => customer might ask for small features
> coolors.co -> website for combination of colors 

- Stakeholders => They are the people who are responsible for if anything goes wrong in the product as they have the authority to change the product. 
Eg : Product Mangers, Team Lead

> Product based companies => the product will be used by more than one customer.
Service based is only a one time thing, only one customer is involved.



## METHODOLOGY

1. WATERFALL 
 Requirements -> Design -> Development -> Delivery -> Maintenance

2. AGILE
  ![alt text](<Screenshot (5).png>)    

- Agile can be used when the requirements are not clear and waterfall can be used when requirements are clear. Customer is not invloved in waterfall in between.

- Waterfall - Migration projects ( when we are changing the from one language to anotheras the requirements are clear because we are only changing the language).

- Waterfall - 6 months to release a version. 
- Agile - its a cyclic process 

- Implentation of Agile:
  1. Scrum is the framework used to do work in agile.(Implementation of agile).

  2. Sprint Planning - It is a meeting for planning. It take 1 hr for sprint planning and task is divided into small chunks.
  3. Story points are estimates to complete a particular work.
  4. Blocker -> anything that stops or slows down the delivery of a product, or acts as a hurdle for the product.( a person is stuck somewhere)
  5. Standup Meetings -> Daily meetings (10-15 min). What happened yesterday and what to do today.
  6. Review Meeting -> meeting after each sprint( after 14 days)
  7. Sprint Retrospective -> What can be improved. Also happens after every sprint.

- ![ ](<Screenshot (7).png>) => kanban board is a tool used to manage sprint.
- peer review => the code is reviewed by other developers.

- burn down chart is the graph of the sprint. It shows whether the tasks are completed accordingly or not.
